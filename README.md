Overview
This project is a Snake Game built using React. The classic snake game involves controlling a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake’s own body. The game speeds up as the snake grows, and the player must control the snake with keyboard input.

Features
Classic Snake Movement: Control the snake using arrow keys or WASD keys.
Food Collection: The snake grows in length as it eats food, and the score increases.
Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake runs into the walls or itself.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player’s score and displays it on the screen.
Responsive Design: The game is responsive and playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
